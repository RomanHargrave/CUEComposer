CUE Composer is a tool for working with CUESheets, the genesis of which was sparked by the lack of such software that was
free, lest compatible with Linux.

It uses [cuelib](RomanHargrave/cuelib) in order to work with CUE files, and as such should support extended sheets
generated by rippers such as EAC and Morituri. Cuelib was originally written by Jan-Willem van den Broek (monstermanual@gmail.com)
and appears to be unmaintained since late 2009. It is my hope that my work on CUE Composer will benefit Cuelib in that
I will likely have to make bug fixes and close the open issues that were ported from gcode.
